# ðŸ“Š Depression Prediction using Bayesian Modeling

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains a project report on **Depression Prediction and Classification using Bayesian Models**, conducted as part of the **Advanced Bayesian Data Analysis** course at **TU Dortmund University**.

The study explores the application of **Bayesian statistics** to predict major depressive disorder (MDD) using real-world survey data. Various **Bayesian logistic regression models** were implemented to analyze relationships between socio-demographic factors and mental health.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Details

- **Course:** Advanced Bayesian Data Analysis
- **Institution:** [TU Dortmund University](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/)
- **Technology Used:** R, Bayesian Inference, Logistic Regression
- **Dataset:** Kaggle & Busara Center for Behavioral Economics
- **Year:** 2024

## ðŸ”¬ Key Aspects of the Study

âœ” **Explored Bayesian modeling techniques** for depression prediction.  
âœ” **Analyzed socio-demographic data** to determine risk factors.  
âœ” **Applied multiple Bayesian models**, including logistic regression and hierarchical models.  
âœ” **Performed posterior predictive checks, model comparisons, and hypothesis testing.**  
âœ” **Used Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) for model evaluation.**  

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Methods

- **Bayesian Logistic Regression:** Used to predict depression cases.
- **Prior Selection:** Defined informative and weakly informative priors.
- **Multilevel Models:** Incorporated hierarchical structures.
- **Model Comparison:** Used LOO-CV and AUC analysis.
- **Convergence Diagnostics:** Assessed model performance and reliability.

## ðŸ“‰ Results & Findings

- Bayesian logistic regression successfully predicted depression likelihood.
- **Age, marital status, and household size** were found to impact depression risk.
- **Multilevel models** provided better predictive performance.
- **LOO-CV and AUC metrics** helped compare different models.
